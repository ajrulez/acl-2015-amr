% The existing AMR corpus is heavily biased to the international newswire domain, making domain transfer of AMR parsing an important challenge. 
% The Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism for which a large and growing set of annotated examples is available.

The Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) is a representation for open-domain rich semantics
Generating semantic sub-graphs from contiguous tokens is a crucial part of AMR parsing.
We propose a small set of actions to \textit{construct} a sub-graph at test time from a span of tokens, which allow us to greatly expand our generalization from training data.
We show that our set of construction actions is a good approximation which we can learn with a simple classifier.
This reduces the need for sparse dictionary lookups, which improves generalization on unknown words and allows us to exploit statistical efficiency on a small training set.
We demonstrate that our approach improves on published state-of-the-art AMR parsing, from \textit{0.58} smatch to \textit{0.64} smatch on the LDC2013E117 dataset.

\section{Introduction}

The Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) \cite{Banarescu:13} is a rich semantic formalism that captures many useful pieces of semantic information in a single joint representation. These include (but are not limited to) named entity recognition, semantic role labeling, word sense disambiguation, and coreference. The AMR sembanking effort promises to produce a breakthrough resource in broad domain semantic parsing, for both its size and the AMR formalism's expressive richness. As of this writing AMR has one published parser, JAMR \cite{Flanigan:14}, which reported very promising results. After experimentation with several different structured prediction algorithms, we find that JAMR's architecture is a very strong framework for further parser development, and present an improvement to the JAMR parser's concept identification stage.

\section{A Crash-Course in AMR}

AMR is a semantic formalism that represents meaning as a directed graph, where nodes represent concepts and arcs are relationships between concepts. AMR makes no effort to have a one-to-one correspondence between nodes in a graph and tokens in a source sentence, and so is not a ``semantic dependency'' representation. In fact, AMR will often expand single tokens into large sub-graph elements, or ignore tokens completely.

\Fig{glee.png}{0.25}{glee}{``He gleefully ran to his dog Rover''}

To introduce AMR and its notation, we'll unpack the translation of the sentence ``he gleefully ran to his dog Rover''. We show in \reffig{glee} the interpretation of this sentence as an AMR graph. Note that the root node of the graph is labeled ``run-01'', which is the name of a frame drawn from PropBank \needcite for the sense of the verb ``ran'' in this sentence. ``run-01'' has an outgoing ``ARG0'' arc to a node ``he'', with semantics drawn from the PropBank frame for ``run-01'' having its ARG0 \textit{be the object} ``he''. The ``run-01'' has an outgoing ``mod'' to ``glee,'' which has the catch-all semantics that ``run-01'' is somehow modified by the concept ``glee.'' ``run-01'' also has a ``destination'' arc to ``dog,'' which draws its semantics from Vivek Srikumar's thesis chapter on preposition sense tagging \needcite. Then we have a section of the graph that is best interpreted as a unit, where all of the children of ``dog'' effectively mean that ``dog'' has the name ``Rover.''

AMR has a specification for writing these potentially cyclic, decidedly non-tree graphs cleanly in text. It works as follows: follow a breadth first traversal of the graph from the root. When you encounter nodes you haven't seen before, write them with a coreference tag and a slash, as in
\begin{verbatim}(h / he)\end{verbatim}
When you encounter nodes you've already written down somewhere else in the written representation, simply write down its coreference tag 
\begin{verbatim}(h)\end{verbatim}
to refer back to the original node unambiguously.

The entire sentence parse for ``he gleefully ran to his dog Rover'' can be written in text form as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
(r / run-01
   :ARG0 (h / he)
   :mod (g / gleeful)
      :destination (d / dog
         :poss-of h)
         :name (n / name
            :op1 "Rover"))
\end{verbatim}

Note the coreference back to the (h / he) from the arc :poss-of out of (d / dog).

\section{Previous Work}

At the time of this writing, the JAMR parser \cite{Flanigan:14} is the only published AMR parser. It uses a two-stage approach to parsing AMR. In the first stage, a sequence model is used to generate small AMR sub-chunks. Then in the second stage these chunks are stitched together by a variation of a maximum spanning tree algorithm with dual decomposition to impose linguistically motivated constraints.

\section{Methods}

AMR training data is in the form of bi-text, where we are given a set of (sentence,graph) pairs, with no explicit alignments between them.

We'll use a running example of a sentence and its corresponding AMR parse throughout this paper, to motivate our method.

\subsection{Electronically-available resources}

We strongly prefer that you prepare your PDF files using \LaTeX\ with
the official ACL 2015 style file (acl2015.sty) and bibliography style
(acl.bst). These files are available at
\url{http://acl2015.org}. You will also find the document
you are currently reading (acl2015.pdf) and its \LaTeX\ source code
(acl2015.tex) on this website.

You can alternatively use Microsoft Word to produce your PDF file. In
this case, we strongly recommend the use of the Word template file
(acl2015.dot) on the ACL 2015 website (\url{http://acl2015.org}). 
If you have an option, we recommend that you use the \LaTeX2e version. 
If you will be using the Microsoft Word template, we suggest that you 
anonymize your source file so that the pdf produced does not retain your
identity.  This can be done by removing any personal information
from your source document properties.



\subsection{Format of Electronic Manuscript}
\label{sect:pdf}

For the production of the electronic manuscript you must use Adobe's
Portable Document Format (PDF). PDF files are usually produced from
\LaTeX\ using the \textit{pdflatex} command. If your version of
\LaTeX\ produces Postscript files, you can convert these into PDF
using \textit{ps2pdf} or \textit{dvipdf}. On Windows, you can also use
Adobe Distiller to generate PDF.

Please make sure that your PDF file includes all the necessary fonts
(especially tree diagrams, symbols, and fonts with Asian
characters). When you print or create the PDF file, there is usually
an option in your printer setup to include none, all or just
non-standard fonts.  Please make sure that you select the option of
including ALL the fonts. \textbf{Before sending it, test your PDF by
  printing it from a computer different from the one where it was
  created.} Moreover, some word processors may generate very large PDF
files, where each page is rendered as an image. Such images may
reproduce poorly. In this case, try alternative ways to obtain the
PDF. One way on some systems is to install a driver for a postscript
printer, send your document to the printer specifying ``Output to a
file'', then convert the file to PDF.

It is of utmost importance to specify the \textbf{A4 format} (21 cm
x 29.7 cm) when formatting the paper. When working with
{\tt dvips}, for instance, one should specify {\tt -t a4}.
Or using the command \verb|\special{papersize=210mm,297mm}| in the latex
preamble (directly below the \verb|\usepackage| commands). Then using 
{\tt dvipdf} and/or {\tt pdflatex} which would make it easier for some.


Print-outs of the PDF file on A4 paper should be identical to the
hardcopy version. If you cannot meet the above requirements about the
production of your electronic submission, please contact the
publication chairs as soon as possible.


\subsection{Layout}
\label{ssec:layout}

Format manuscripts two columns to a page, in the manner these
instructions are formatted. The exact dimensions for a page on A4
paper are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Left and right margins: 2.5 cm
\item Top margin: 2.5 cm
\item Bottom margin: 2.5 cm
\item Column width: 7.7 cm
\item Column height: 24.7 cm
\item Gap between columns: 0.6 cm
\end{itemize}

\noindent Papers should not be submitted on any other paper size.
 If you cannot meet the above requirements about the production of 
 your electronic submission, please contact the publication chairs 
 above as soon as possible.


\subsection{Fonts}

For reasons of uniformity, Adobe's {\bf Times Roman} font should be
used. In \LaTeX2e{} this is accomplished by putting

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage{times}
\usepackage{latexsym}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
in the preamble. If Times Roman is unavailable, use {\bf Computer
  Modern Roman} (\LaTeX2e{}'s default).  Note that the latter is about
  10\% less dense than Adobe's Times Roman font.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{font-table} Font guide. }
\end{table}

\subsection{The First Page}
\label{ssec:first}

Center the title, author's name(s) and affiliation(s) across both
columns. Do not use footnotes for affiliations. Do not include the
paper ID number assigned during the submission process. Use the
two-column format only when you begin the abstract.

{\bf Title}: Place the title centered at the top of the first page, in
a 15-point bold font. (For a complete guide to font sizes and styles,
see Table~\ref{font-table}) Long titles should be typed on two lines
without a blank line intervening. Approximately, put the title at 2.5
cm from the top of the page, followed by a blank line, then the
author's names(s), and the affiliation on the following line. Do not
use only initials for given names (middle initials are allowed). Do
not format surnames in all capitals (e.g., use ``Schlangen'' not
``SCHLANGEN'').  Do not format title and section headings in all
capitals as well except for proper names (such as ``BLEU'') that are
conventionally in all capitals.  The affiliation should contain the
author's complete address, and if possible, an electronic mail
address. Start the body of the first page 7.5 cm from the top of the
page.

The title, author names and addresses should be completely identical
to those entered to the electronical paper submission website in order
to maintain the consistency of author information among all
publications of the conference. If they are different, the publication
chairs may resolve the difference without consulting with you; so it
is in your own interest to double-check that the information is
consistent.

{\bf Abstract}: Type the abstract at the beginning of the first
column. The width of the abstract text should be smaller than the
width of the columns for the text in the body of the paper by about
0.6 cm on each side. Center the word {\bf Abstract} in a 12 point bold
font above the body of the abstract. The abstract should be a concise
summary of the general thesis and conclusions of the paper. It should
be no longer than 200 words. The abstract text should be in 10 point font.

{\bf Text}: Begin typing the main body of the text immediately after
the abstract, observing the two-column format as shown in 
the present document. Do not include page numbers.

{\bf Indent} when starting a new paragraph. Use 11 points for text and 
subsection headings, 12 points for section headings and 15 points for
the title. 

\subsection{Sections}

{\bf Headings}: Type and label section and subsection headings in the
style shown on the present document.  Use numbered sections (Arabic
numerals) in order to facilitate cross references. Number subsections
with the section number and the subsection number separated by a dot,
in Arabic numerals. Do not number subsubsections.

{\bf Citations}: Citations within the text appear in parentheses
as~\cite{Gusfield:97} or, if the author's name appears in the text
itself, as Gusfield~\shortcite{Gusfield:97}.  Append lowercase letters
to the year in cases of ambiguity.  Treat double authors as
in~\cite{Aho:72}, but write as in~\cite{Chandra:81} when more than two
authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as
in~\cite{Gusfield:97,Aho:72}. Also refrain from using full citations
as sentence constituents. We suggest that instead of
\begin{quote}
  ``\cite{Gusfield:97} showed that ...''
\end{quote}
you use
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}   showed that ...''
\end{quote}

If you are using the provided \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files, you
can use the command \verb|\newcite| to get ``author (year)'' citations.

As reviewing will be double-blind, the submitted version of the papers
should not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore,
self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g.,
\begin{quote}
``We previously showed \cite{Gusfield:97} ...''  
\end{quote}
should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as 
\begin{quote}
``Gusfield \shortcite{Gusfield:97}
previously showed ... ''
\end{quote}

\textbf{Please do not use anonymous citations} and do not include
acknowledgements when submitting your papers. Papers that do not
conform to these requirements may be rejected without review.

\textbf{References}: Gather the full set of references together under
the heading {\bf References}; place the section before any Appendices,
unless they contain references. Arrange the references alphabetically
by first author, rather than by order of occurrence in the text.
Provide as complete a citation as possible, using a consistent format,
such as the one for {\em Computational Linguistics\/} or the one in the 
{\em Publication Manual of the American 
Psychological Association\/}~\cite{APA:83}.  Use of full names for
authors rather than initials is preferred.  A list of abbreviations
for common computer science journals can be found in the ACM 
{\em Computing Reviews\/}~\cite{ACM:83}.

The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly fit the
American Psychological Association format, allowing regular citations, 
short citations and multiple citations as described above.

{\bf Appendices}: Appendices, if any, directly follow the text and the
references (but see above).  Letter them in sequence and provide an
informative title: {\bf Appendix A. Title of Appendix}.

\subsection{Footnotes}

{\bf Footnotes}: Put footnotes at the bottom of the page and use 9
points text. They may be numbered or referred to by asterisks or other
symbols.\footnote{This is how a footnote should appear.} Footnotes
should be separated from the text by a line.\footnote{Note the line
separating the footnotes from the text.}

\subsection{Graphics}

{\bf Illustrations}: Place figures, tables, and photographs in the
paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if
possible.  Wide illustrations may run across both columns.  Color
illustrations are discouraged, unless you have verified that  
they will be understandable when printed in black ink.

{\bf Captions}: Provide a caption for every illustration; number each one
sequentially in the form:  ``Figure 1. Caption of the Figure.'' ``Table 1.
Caption of the Table.''  Type the captions of the figures and 
tables below the body, using 11 point text.


\section{XML conversion and supported \LaTeX\ packages}

Following ACL 2014 we will also we will attempt to automatically convert 
your \LaTeX\ source files to publish papers in machine-readable 
XML with semantic markup in the ACL Anthology, in addition to the 
traditional PDF format.  This will allow us to create, over the next 
few years, a growing corpus of scientific text for our own future research, 
and picks up on recent initiatives on converting ACL papers from earlier 
years to XML. 

We encourage you to submit a ZIP file of your \LaTeX\ sources along
with the camera-ready version of your paper. We will then convert them
to XML automatically, using the LaTeXML tool
(\url{http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML}). LaTeXML has \emph{bindings} for
a number of \LaTeX\ packages, including the ACL 2015 stylefile. These
bindings allow LaTeXML to render the commands from these packages
correctly in XML. For best results, we encourage you to use the
packages that are officially supported by LaTeXML, listed at
\url{http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/manual/included.bindings}





\section{Translation of non-English Terms}

It is also advised to supplement non-English characters and terms
with appropriate transliterations and/or translations
since not all readers understand all such characters and terms.
Inline transliteration or translation can be represented in
the order of: original-form transliteration ``translation''.

\section{Length of Submission}
\label{sec:length}

Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus two extra
pages for references. Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of
content, plus two extra pages for references.  Papers that do not
conform to the specified length and formatting requirements may be
rejected without review.



\section*{Acknowledgments}

The acknowledgments should go immediately before the references.  Do
not number the acknowledgments section. Do not include this section
